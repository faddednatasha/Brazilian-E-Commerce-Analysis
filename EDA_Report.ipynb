        "## 1. Dataset at a Glance\n",
        "\n",
        "We’re working with a large e-commerce dataset that captures everything from **orders and payments** to **deliveries and customer reviews**.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Size:** ~116,000 orders placed by 100,000+ customers.\n",
        "- **What’s inside?**\n",
        "  - **Orders & Customers** → who bought what, when, and from where.\n",
        "  - **Deliveries** → when packages were shipped and delivered (and if they were late).\n",
        "  - **Products & Prices** → category and cost of items.\n",
        "  - **Payments** → type (credit, debit, installments) and installments count.\n",
        "  - **Reviews** → customer satisfaction (1–5 stars).\n",
        "\n",
        "Think of it as a complete journey: from clicking \"buy\" → to waiting for delivery → to leaving a review.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## 2. How We Explored the Data\n",
        "\n",
        "Our plan was simple:\n",
        "1. **Get to know the data** – check for missing values, outliers.\n",
        "2. **Customer behavior** – where they live, how they pay.\n",
        "3. **Delivery performance** – how late deliveries affect reviews.\n",
        "4. **Product analysis** – what sells more and in which categories.\n",
        "5. **Trends over time** – weekday vs weekend shopping.\n",
        "6. **Test assumptions** – run statistical tests to back up insights.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## 3. Cleaning & Feature Engineering\n",
        "\n",
        "To make the dataset analysis-ready, we did a few tweaks:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Filled or dropped missing dates.\n",
        "- Created new features like:\n",
        "  - `delivery_delay` → days late (if any).\n",
        "  - `is_late` → flagging delayed orders.\n",
        "  - `order_day_of_week` + `is_weekend` → to study time patterns.\n",
        "- Encoded categorical values (payment types, states) for easier analysis.\n",

        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## 4. What We Found (EDA Highlights)\n",
        "\n",
        "###  Reviews\n",
        "- Most customers left **4–5 star reviews**.\n",
        "- But when deliveries were late, reviews dropped **dramatically**.\n",
        "\n",
        "###  Payment Behavior\n",
        "- Majority paid in **single installment**.\n",
        "- Installments were popular in **electronics & furniture**, i.e., high-ticket items.\n",
        "\n",
        "###  Sales Trends\n",
        "- Sales were **slightly higher on weekdays**.\n",
        "- Mid-week (Tuesday–Thursday) saw the **highest activity**.\n",
        "\n",
        "###  Customer Locations\n",
        "- Customers spread across **23 states**.\n",
        "- **Urban states** had quicker deliveries, while **remote states** faced more delays.\n",

        "\n",
        "We didn’t just look at trends — we tested them statistically:\n",
        "\n",
        "### H1: Delivery Delays vs Reviews\n",
        "- **Finding:** Late deliveries = lower ratings.\n",
        "- Each day of delay shaved off ~0.013 rating points.\n",
        "✅ Strong evidence: delivery time directly affects satisfaction.\n",
        "\n",
        "### H2: Installments vs Category\n",
        "- **Finding:** Installments heavily used in **high-priced categories**.\n",
        "✅ Confirmed: not all products are equal when it comes to financing.\n",
        "\n",
        "### H3: Weekday vs Weekend Sales\n",
        "- **Finding:** Weekdays see **slightly higher sales**.\n",
        "✅ Confirmed: small but consistent difference.\n",
        "\n",
        "### H4: Customer Location vs Delivery Delays\n",
        "- **Finding:** State does matter, but only explains a **small fraction** of delays.\n",
        "✅ Confirmed: logistics complexity is beyond just geography.\n",

        "## 6. Key Insights\n",

        "  - Build **predictive models** for delivery delays & review scores.\n",
        "  - Do a **cohort analysis** to understand repeat buyers.\n",
        "  - Explore **recommendation systems** for product suggestions.\n",
